 Created Django project structure (taskmanager) and initialized Git repository.
 Created base apps: users (for authentication/profile) and tasks (for task management).
 Defined initial models: CustomUser (extends Django's AbstractUser) and Task (with fields like title, description, status, due_date, owner).
 Ran initial migrations and tested basic setup.
